I intend on planning / highlighting progress in this directory,
instead of segregating it to one of the 5 repos Handwriter spans.

Image Analyze is my priority over break.

To summate, I want the user to interact with an uploaded sample by clicking on a letter / filter.

Step 0 is including filters, to see the thinned, unthinned, and both plots upon click.

Step * : risk a bunch sof hours using opencv for dynamic image detection
probably gonna try this because this experience will follow me through the project

Step 1 is addressing issues before implementing ((or burning 15 hours by strugging with css :p :p))

ISSUE: Unfixed images,

We must fix images to a certain size for my program to know where to highlight.

Theres 0 connection between the letters and their positions of the original document, except from my features.
